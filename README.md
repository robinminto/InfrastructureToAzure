# Automated deployment of infrastructure to Azure
This code was used during the Sheffield DevOps session on 14th April6. The code was put together to demonstrate a number of technologies and is not intended for production use. If you to suggest an improvement (which I am aware there are many!) please feel free to create a pull request on the master branch.

The session can be replicated for free (including Azure credit) using Visual Studio DevEssentials: <https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-dev-essentials-vs.aspx>

Resources refered to during the session included:

* PowerShell Gallery: <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages>
